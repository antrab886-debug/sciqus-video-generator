The global economy is currently bleeding 5 Trillion dollars in sales every year. The cause isn't the market, and it isn't the product. It’s simply... poor Account Management. In B2B today, growth doesn’t come from new deals alone. It comes from renewals, expansions, and long-term relationships. Yet most companies still rely on tools built only for sales. Once a deal is closed, everything becomes fragmented. Tickets live in one system. Renewals live in spreadsheets. Communication lives in inboxes. And no one has a complete view of the account. That’s the real gap. CRM manages leads and pipelines. But account management is about trust, delivery, and growth. And it needs its own system. This is why Account Management is emerging as its own SaaS category. A category focused on managing existing customers — not just closing them. That’s exactly why we built Sciqus AMS — an end-to-end account management solution designed for retention, visibility, and long-term growth. Startups bleed churn, but even the Fortune 500 loses 5.4 Billion dollars a year just because departments don't collaborate. This is exactly the gap Sciqus AMS was engineered to close. So, is your team truly collaborating on account growth, or are you still letting revenue slip through the cracks of your CRM? ”
